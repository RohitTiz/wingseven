While classical computers use bits that can be either 0 or 1, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits that can exist in multiple states simultaneously through superposition. This fundamental difference enables quantum computers to solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical computers. In this article, we'll explore how quantum algorithms are tackling previously impossible problems and what the future holds for this transformative technology."
